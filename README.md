# clang-format pre-commit hook

For a short period of time, this repository contained a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook to apply
[clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) using
[wheels](https://github.com/ssciwr/clang-format-wheel).

The hook can now be found at [https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format).
Please use it from there - this repository will be archived in the near future.
